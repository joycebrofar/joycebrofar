# Hi there, I'm Joyce Ann Brofar üëã

## About Me

An enthusiastic educator and information technology advocate, I am currently pursuing a Master in Information Technology at De La Salle University, Manila, with an expected completion in 2025. Additionally, I recently earned an Executive Diploma in Business Communication from UniAthena, further enhancing my ability to bridge technology with effective communication. My academic foundation in technology was laid with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, which I completed in 2013 at AMA Computer College, Santa Cruz.

Since 2013, I‚Äôve been committed to the practical application of technology in educational environments. My experience as an ICT Coordinator at the Alternative Learning System from 2013 to 2019 allowed me to play a key role in creating inclusive, tech-integrated learning spaces.

Today, I have the opportunity to inspire and mentor students as a part-time College Teacher at STI College Calamba, where I specialize in Theory of Computations with Automata and Software Engineering. My passion lies in empowering future innovators through technology and education, shaping their skills to thrive in the digital world.

I‚Äôm always open to connecting and collaborating on projects at the intersection of education and technology. Feel free to reach out, and let‚Äôs make a positive impact together!
