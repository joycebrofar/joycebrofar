# Hi there, I'm Joyce Ann Brofar 👋

## About Me

An avid educator and information technology enthusiast. With a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from AMA Computer College - Santa Cruz, I entered the dynamic world of technology in 2013. My journey in the field led me to pursue further academic excellence, and I am currently undertaking a Master's in Information Technology at De La Salle University.

With a strong background in IT, I delved into the practical application of technology in education, serving as an ICT Coordinator at the Alternative Learning System from 2013 to 2019. This role allowed me to contribute significantly to integrating technology in educational settings, fostering a more inclusive and accessible learning environment.

Currently, I have the privilege of imparting my knowledge and experience to bright young minds at STI College Calamba, where I am actively engaged in educating and mentoring college students. My passion for empowering the next generation through technology and education continues to drive my professional journey.

Feel free to reach out to me to talk about exciting opportunities in education and technology. Let's collaborate and make a positive impact in the digital landscape together!
